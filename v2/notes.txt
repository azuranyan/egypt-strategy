- Resources have to be @tool if used in tool scripts otherwise its methods won't be found. it works in-game though.
- resources don't save their variables if not @export-ed or get_property_list(?)
	- exporting automatically lists the property in property list
	- this is useful for stateful and runtime things but have to be kept in mind
- tool scripts fail silently and abandons current function and continues if encountering an error
- tool doesn't call init on (pre)loaded resources on reload scene (only once, from reload project)
	- works as intended, but should be wary of when testing
- another init: nodes can have children but they are inaccessible from init.
- call down, signal up or sibling
	- don't access tree in setters, use signals. signal down if necessaryinit and there's no way to find out if you have child or not from there.
- setting owner allows a node to be saved along with its owner. do not set for transient object
- export_subgroup and export_category with same name as a class may break the class
- positive rotation is fucking clockwise
