"All Avatars except Lysandra have the exact same stats as their friendly versions. However; they gain stats equivalent to 1 level of Bond when they win a territory, not to exceed the max of 3. They do not get the 2nd Skill from this."

dialogue hooks
 - print statement for dialogue

scriptable events/battle world state
 - unified battle api where all the functions are there instead of fiddling the classes themselves
 - this should clean up the mess that you currently have to do with units and map and stuff


## minor
ui elements need to be canvaslayer to bypass camera and viewport transforms
prep uses global coords to bypass camera problems
prep keyboard control
should behavior really need to be on unittype (ai behavior)
mark units with something when they have taken turn (E) in disgaea
more robust cast animation system


## would be nice
disgaea style enum targetable units in attack range
disgaea style target and caster placement 
damage counter for consecutive attacks
allow scrolling on character list
Globals empires, territories -> empire, territory
feature affect_caster (effect is used on the caster instead of target)
 - modify z series of effects (i.e. effects that affect caster)
ugly cell() casting because of round: don't apply 0.5 to world and let map object center themselves
AttackEffect.get_animation() -> get_target_special_effect() or something else, as animation is specifically animation strings

## hot list
##########################################################################################################

add check for bond level up after turn ends

knockback allows knocking enemies out of bounds LMAO
 - check other movement based skills too

await for overworld battle to end
 - everyone takes their turn while you are fighting
 - breaks the turn order code

battle win loss conditions
 - evaluate win loss
 - add custom win loss conditions
 - battle prep conditions
 - attacker/defender victory/withdraw

display targeting info
 - list of units that will be hit by the attack
 - attack being used

implement multicast
 - if it's already selected, deselect

before every effect, check if target is still alive
 - once unit dies, put in dead_queue
 - after turn cycle ends, clear all dead units
 - maybe status effect bug is related to unit dying and getting cleared

prep drag and drop broken

unit states [standby, alive, action_taken, dead, ghost]
 - standby units are spawned in but placed out of bounds and can't be interacted with
 - alive units and dead units are self explanatory
 - action_taken is a special substate of alive where it's alive but cannot take any more actions
 - ghost units are not interactible and is not bound to the same rules and exists for ui and stuf

unit -> unitid, so it doesn't rely on unit names and multiple unit types can be spawned

make use of groups

ui being shown in battle signal is wrong
 - some parts of the ui are player specific but will be shown even for ai

for manager classes, context/state are variables needed to resume a saved game
 - the rest of the variables are assumed to be transient and runtime only
