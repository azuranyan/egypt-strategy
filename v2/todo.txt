## to fix
overworld ui elements not hidden when going to battle
ugly cell() casting because of round: don't apply 0.5 to world and let map object center themselves
where camera is parented is important

## to implement
turn end
unit and attack data
 - determine depth of attacks
 - custom attack scripts if needed
 - better attack animation handling
enemy ai controls
prep keyboard controls

## minor
flood fill algorithm is suboptimal
prep uses global coords to bypass camera problems
ui elements need to be canvaslayer to bypass camera and viewport transforms
