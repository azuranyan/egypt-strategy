## to fix
overworld ui elements not hidden when going to battle
ugly cell() casting because of round: don't apply 0.5 to world and let map object center themselves
where camera is parented is important
special should only be available at bond 3

## to implement
bond levelling
status proc on turn start

knockback
inflict random ailment [% table]
feature to select however many targets have been selected
 - if it's already selected, deselect
use csv

"All Avatars except Lysandra have the exact same stats as their friendly versions. However; they gain stats equivalent to 1 level of Bond when they win a territory, not to exceed the max of 3. They do not get the 2nd Skill from this."

component system for attack
- damage
- status effect
- 


## minor
flood fill algorithm is suboptimal
prep uses global coords to bypass camera problems
ui elements need to be canvaslayer to bypass camera and viewport transforms
should behavior really need to be on unittype
mark units with something when they have taken turn (E) in disgaea
if enemy turn, hide cursor
on your turn show cursor and pan to cursor
hearts ui battle
