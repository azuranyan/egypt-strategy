## to fix
overworld ui elements not hidden when going to battle
ugly cell() casting because of round: don't apply 0.5 to world and let map object center themselves
special should only be available at bond 3

## to implement
bond levelling
status proc on turn start

"All Avatars except Lysandra have the exact same stats as their friendly versions. However; they gain stats equivalent to 1 level of Bond when they win a territory, not to exceed the max of 3. They do not get the 2nd Skill from this."

component system for attack
- damage
- status effect
- 


## minor
prep uses global coords to bypass camera problems
prep control keyboard
ui elements need to be canvaslayer to bypass camera and viewport transforms
should behavior really need to be on unittype
mark units with something when they have taken turn (E) in disgaea
remove action limit

feature to select however many targets have been selected
 - if it's already selected, deselect

feature affect_caster (effect is used on the caster instead of target)
 - modify z series of effects (effects that affect caster)

before every effect, check if target is still alive
 - once unit dies, put in dead_queue
 - after turn cycle ends, clear all dead units
